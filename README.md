Pie and Donut Chart Evaluation
========

This project was used in a study that used the Mechanical Turk platform to test a series of pie chart variations.

The study is built on the excellent [Experimentr.js project](https://github.com/codementum/experimentr/blob/master/public/experimentr.js).

Data
===
The collected data files are in the `analysis/results` directory.

### Data Files

* `reshaped-unique.csv`:  trial data in CSV format, with incomplete trials removed
* `demographics.csv`: demographics data in CSV format
* `merged-data.csv`: trial data with demographics data included on every row.

|Field Name|Description|
|--------|--------|
| _time\_start\_time-trial_ | Unix time for beginning of the question |
| _time\_end\_time-trial_	| Unix time for ending of the question (if this is missing, it is the same as time_end_trials from the demographics data)|
| _rotation_ | randomly selected rotation value showing the chart's rotation |
| _log\_error_ | Log absolute error as reported in the paper |
| _totalSequence_ | Position within the entire study for that participant |
| _arc\_angle\_area_ | answer to multiple choice question asking participant whether they preferred using arc-length, angle, or area in their judgements |
| _judged\_true_ | Judged answer minus true answer |
| _ans\_percentage\_diff_ | (given-correct)/correct |
| _opposite\_ans_ | 100 - correct\_ans |
| _chart\_type_ | Pie, Donut, Arc-Length, Area, Pie Angle, Pie Donut |
| _ans\_trial_ | Given answer |
| _postID_ | ID generated by experimentr |
| _time\_diff_time_ | Time in miliseconds that it took to answer the question |
| _correct\_ans_ | Correct answer |


Running The Study
===

To run the project, you'll need [Redis](http://redis.io/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

To start the Redis server, run the following command from the project directory:

	redis-server redis.conf

The Node server works on port 80, so it needs root access, and the project is set to use [Forever.js](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever) to ensure it keeps running:

	forever start app.js

Once you have the project running, you can visit _localhost_ in your browser to see the survey.
